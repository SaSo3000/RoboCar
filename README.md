# Arrow Direction Recognition using Neural Network & MQTT Communication  

## Description  
This project implements an **arrow direction recognition system** using a **neural network** trained with PyTorch. The trained model classifies arrow images into four categories: **Left, Right, Forward, and Back**.  
A **Raspberry Pi with a camera module** is used for real-time image capture, and the recognized direction is published via **MQTT** for IoT applications.  

---

## Features  
âœ” Neural network trained using PyTorch with four direction classes.  
âœ” Image preprocessing using OpenCV (grayscale, resize, normalize).  
âœ” Real-time image capture using Raspberry Pi's **Picamera2** module.  
âœ” **MQTT integration** to publish predicted directions to an IoT network.

1. Train the Model
Run train_model.py to train a neural network on your dataset.

2. Run Real-Time Prediction
Use the trained model to classify live images from a Raspberry Pi camera:


python image_recognition.py
Press 'c' to capture an image and predict its direction.
Press 'q' to quit the program.
